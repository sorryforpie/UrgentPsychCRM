# UrgentPsychCRM

This repository contains the starting point for **UrgentPsychCRM**, a Next.js
application designed for psychiatrists or small teams. The goal is to provide a
premium, ultra-minimal CRM interface with a calm, native-app feel.

## Project Description

Design a full-screen, ultra-minimal, premium CRM interface for psychiatrists or
small teams of them. Focus on layout, spacing, typography, and aesthetic—not
placeholder content. Use a two-column structure where needed, consistent visual
rhythm, soft shadows, and large touch targets. Every screen should feel polished
and deliberate, with a native app-like feel.

### UI Style
- Apple-like calm aesthetic with subtle gradients or shadows
- Neutral background (`#F9FAFB` or similar) and dark text (`#1A1A1A`)
- Elegant accent color (deep indigo or forest green)
- Inter or SF Pro typography
- Generous padding and consistent vertical rhythm
- Rounded card corners, hover shadows, and light dividers
- Lucide or Feather-style line icons

### Screens
1. **Dashboard Overview** – Modular card layout with sidebar navigation.
2. **Matters List View** – Clean table or card view with filters.
3. **Matter Detail Page** – Split layout with tabbed content.
4. **Patient Directory** – Searchable table or grid with avatars.
5. **Patient Profile Page** – Metadata, timeline, and related items.
6.1 **Referral Management Centre** – Upload referral templates in folders.
6.2 **Community Resource Management Centre** – Upload resources with print options.
7. **Document Management** – Grid/folder UI with drag-and-drop.
8. **Calendar View** – Monthly/weekly views with color-coded badges.
9. **Time Tracking / Billing** – Timer UI with invoice cards.
10. **Patient Portal View (Read Only)** – Locked fields with timelines.
11. **Settings** – Grouped sections with toggles and permissions.

A collapsible left sidebar will link to each page above.

This repository currently provides the basic project structure so development can
start quickly.
